## Note
We're not going to proceed with the functionalities yet. Focus on developing the interface and the components. Ensuring it is responsive and intuitive. 

To add, we must made a color theming for both dark and light mode.  Since Daisy UI will be used along with tailwind, we can utilize their theme generator for more easy color scheme creation. https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/
